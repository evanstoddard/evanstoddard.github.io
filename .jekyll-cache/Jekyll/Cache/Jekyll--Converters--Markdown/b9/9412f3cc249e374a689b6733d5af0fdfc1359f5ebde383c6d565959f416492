I"ü<p>Well, after years of half-built pages and <i>Under Contruction</i> pages, I finally have a site up with a blog.  I wanted to have a trendy portfolio with a cool view of all the projects I've worked on, but I realized that wasn't what I wanted.  I also, quite frankly, didn't have any projects to show.  So those sites would never look right.  I was trying to impress people that I didn't need to impress.  Honestly, they never would be impressed by anything I've done since nothing was ever finished!</p>
