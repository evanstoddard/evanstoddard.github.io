<p>Palm OS based PDAs hold a special place in my heart.  I was born in 1997 with two sisters from the 80s and a dad that catered to my technical interests.  I grew up with a classic Macintosh and dial-up internet evnetually getting hand-me-down G3 based Macs.  Late 90s tech was all around me.  The one device that I absolutely covetted was the Palm PDA.</p>

<p>At 6 years old, I knew nothing about them other than they played Minesweeper and that I really wanted one.  My parents, however, had no use for one.  And, quite frankly, neither did I.</p>

<p>Fast forward just a couple years and my dream came true!  A family friend handed me down their Zire 21.  A year later, a teacher gifted me an old Handspring Visor.</p>

<p>As handheld tech got more advanced and smartphones became commonplace, more of these Palm devices would find their way to me.  However, these devices I once lusted after would just end up in a drawer.  It wasnâ€™t until I realized I could write software for these devices that fire in my heart was relit.</p>

<h2 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h2>
<p>Up until very recently (2021-2022), I had next to zero knowledge of Handspring.  I knew there was a device called the Handspring Visor (since I had one as a kid) and that it ran Palm OS, but I had no clue the impact the company had on modern cellphones (THEY INVENTED THE FREAKING TREO FFS!)</p>

<p>The Verge put out a fantastic documentary on Handspring.  The video is embedded below and a brief write up of the article can be found at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone">https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone</a>.</p>
