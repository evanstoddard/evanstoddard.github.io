<p>Palm OS based PDAs hold a special place in my heart.  I was born in 1997 with two sisters from the 80s and a dad that catered to my technical interests.  I grew up with a classic Macintosh and dial-up internet evnetually getting hand-me-down G3 based Macs.  Late 90s tech was all around me.  The one device that I absolutely covetted was the Palm PDA.</p>

<p>At 6 years old, I knew nothing about them other than they played Minesweeper and that I really wanted one.  My parents, however, had no use for one.  And, quite frankly, neither did I.</p>

<p>Fast forward just a couple years and my dream came true!  A family friend handed me down their Zire 21.  A year later, a teacher gifted me an old Handspring.
