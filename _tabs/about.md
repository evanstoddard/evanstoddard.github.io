## Hey, I'm Evan

Based out of Nashville, TN, I'm a senior firmware engineer, currently at [Ovyl](https://ovyl.io). This site is a collection of projects, deep dives, and the occasional brain dump. If you're into embedded systems, wireless protocols, or just want to watch someone use a technology incorrectly with a lot of enthusiasm, you're in the right place.

## Work

At Ovyl, I work on a pretty wide range of embedded projects — medical devices, IoT, industrial stuff. I've developed a soft spot for communication stacks and system architecture, and I'm always chasing clean abstractions and well-defined APIs (as you'll probably notice if you read any of my posts).

I'm a big [Zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org/) advocate. I've been porting projects to Zephyr at work and in my spare time. 

For instance, I'm very slowly chipping away at a port of [PebbleOS](https://github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS) in the little free time I have.  You can check out and judge my progress here: [https://github.com/evanstoddard/PebbleOS](https://github.com/evanstoddard/PebbleOS) 


## Not Work

Born in Buffalo, NY during a snowstorm, I'm a diehard Bills fan.

I've got two dogs, Alfie and Darla, who have both earned the honor of having protocols named after them in my [DECT NR+ project](https://evanstoddard.com/posts/dect_nr_plus_alfie_part_1/). Alfie is "A Little Frequency Is Enough." Darla will get her namesake later in the series.

When I'm not running `west build --pristine`, you can find me and my wife exploring the music and food scene in Nashville.
