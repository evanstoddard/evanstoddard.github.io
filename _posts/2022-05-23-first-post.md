## Here Goes Nothing

Well, after years of half-built pages and *Under Contruction* pages, I finally have a site up with a blog.  I wanted to have a trendy portfolio with a cool view of all the projects I've worked on, but I realized that wasn't what I wanted.  I also, quite frankly, didn't have any projects to show.  So those sites would never look right.  I was trying to impress people that I didn't need to impress.  Honestly, they never would be impressed by anything I've done since nothing was ever finished!

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Howdy!" << std::endl;
}
```

So where do I go from here?  Well I created this site to *try* keeping me accountable towards working on personal projects.  I also wanted to improve my skills in writing and content creation.

## What to Expect?

Well, there's going to be all sorts of stuff.  I've got plenty of ideas for personal projects.  I'm hoping to treat some projects as an on going series.  Those series will have status updates, posts about frustrations with that project, major break throughs, and technical write ups.  There will, of course, be links to source code and resources that are created throughout the project.

There will hopefully be posts about things that I learn.  Hopefully there are things that I become an *expert* on can can share that knowledge with the world.

I don't know if anyone will read anything that gets posted on this site.  So, at the very least, I want it to be a journal of what I've done so I can see that I'e accomplished something!  I tend to lose sight of the good things that I've done and focus on all that I haven't done.

To anyone who does read this, I wrote this for both of us.  I hope it suits the reader well.
