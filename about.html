<p>Hi!</p>

<p>My name is Evan Stoddard.  I'm an embedded software engineer living in Nashville, TN originally from Buffalo, NY (go Bills!)</p>

<p>I graduated from Clarkson University in 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering.  My interests were primarily set in FPGA design dealing with various communication protocols (AXI, PCIe, etc.)  I further developed these skills working for Lockheed Martin for ~2 years.</p>

<p>I currently work for Skip Line, LLC working on making roadways safer as well as trying to modernize infrastructure.</p>

<p>This site is a collection of various projects I'm working on.  Some technical, some not.  Please enjoy and if anything sparks interest, please feel free to reach out!</p>
